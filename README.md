# GymFinderApplication

Bodyweight exercises provide an excellent means of promoting physical activity and maintaining a healthy lifestyle,
as they do not require expensive equipment or gym memberships.
However, for many individuals, finding an appropriate outdoor space with the necessary equipment can prove challenging.
Fortunately, the Free Outdoor Gym Finder application offers an effective solution by enabling users to locate the 
nearest outdoor gym setting with a diverse range of bodyweight exercise equipment.

#objective:
Upon entering the application, users are greeted with the main view, which prominently features the nearest outdoor gym location.
● This serves as a key feature of the welcoming page, as it quickly and efficiently directs users toward a location where they can engage in physical activity.

The main view is also equipped with a menu bar, a search function, a button to add new locations, and an arrow sign to allow the user to navigate to their current location quickly.
● These features serve to enhance the user experience, enabling them to easily access the tools and information necessary to find and engage with outdoor gyms in their area.

#Tech Stacks
● Our objective is to deliver an exceptional interactive mobile application to our users.
● However, a critical aspect of our planning process entails determining the appropriate
platform on which to develop the application, either iOS or Android.
● we have opted to utilize Swift, in conjunction with SwiftUI, to construct the application to
be deployed on an iOS environment.

#Technical Issues
Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for developers to make applications for their ecosystem, such as iOS, TvOS, iPadOS, and watchOS apps.
However, the main takeaway of this project is that our application cannot be made on just any operating system or development environment.

#Application Development
● The application uses MapKit, which is a native framework developed by Apple themselves to provide location data, and geocoding.
● The Outdoor Gym Finder Application has different class folders, Organizing our project into folder helps improve the maintenance.
● The swift files are packaged into folders under standard naming conventions to provide maintainability.
